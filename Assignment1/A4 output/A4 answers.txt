Questions-

1.	How is array declaration and initialization handled?
Ans- Arrays are declared separately in single statement just like the declaration of integer. Initialization also takes place separately one element per statement. 

2.	Why does the statement a[i] = b[i] get broken down to two steps with an intermediate temporary?
Ans- It is because at a time only one operation can take place, it is bit easy and simplifies the other operations too.

3.	Why are there CLOBBER statements at the end?
Ans- The CLOBBER statement is at the end maybe to mark the end of arrays and to simplify the analysis.
