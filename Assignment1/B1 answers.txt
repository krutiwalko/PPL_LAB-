Questions-

1.	The body of AddTwo(x) seems to be inlined into the call of main rendering the function useless (nobody else is calling it). Then why is the definition of AddTwo(x) still there 
all the way till the last pass?
Ans- I do not know. Maybe it is the format of the code.

2.	Is there any way to get rid of it?
Ans- Add the static keyword to the prototype to signify that its linkage is internal only.
