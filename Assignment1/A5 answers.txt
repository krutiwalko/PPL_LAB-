Questions-

1.	Do you notice that each usage of local variable as an operand uses a suffix that can be tracked to its assignment? Why do some variables have a suffix `(D)'?
Ans- Yes. To implement the code in SSA form the variable use suffix as (D). 

2.	 Find the point in the CFG in which the paths of the two assignments to variable `a' and `b' merge. You will notice that PHI statements have been introduced. Can you guess
 the syntax of the PHI statements?
Ans- The syntax of PHI is PHI< precise_1, precise_2, â€¦., precise_i> where precise_i is name(bb). In cfg, the path of variable a and b merge in a PHI statement. 

3.	 Can you think of an example in which a PHI node merges more than two versions of a variable?
Ans- In nested if-else loop or in switch statements (test value of variables with  multiple variable) are the example of PHI node.
